            <article>
                <p>My portraiture gallery comes with features that enables me to upload images, organize them, and ensuring the database reflects the newly uploaded images.
                    I choosed Supabase because it makes authentication, storage, and database management much simpler to use. 
                </p>

                <h2>Setting Up Supabase</h2>
                <p>First, I created a Supabase project that acts as a container, and set up my database.
                    My table for storing images looks like this:
                </p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Data</th>
                        <th>Type</th>
                        <th>Description</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>id</td>
                        <td>uuid</td>
                        <td>Primary key, auto-generated</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>image_url</td>
                        <td>text</td>
                        <td>Supabase Storage URL</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>title</td>
                        <td>text</td>
                        <td>Name or title of the images</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>created_at</td>
                        <td>timestamp</td>
                        <td>When the image was uploaded</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>This simple database schema is enough to store all the relevant details about each portrait.</p>

                <h2>Building the Admin Page</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Login Authentication:</li>
                    <p>Using Supabase Auth, I created a secure login page so only I can access the admin interface.</p>

                    <li>Image Upload Form:</li>
                    <p>A simple form that allows me to select an image, enter a title and description, and submit it.
                        On submission, the image gets uploaded to Supabase Storage.
                    </p>

                    <li>Database Insertion:</li>
                    <p>Once the image is uploaded, I insert a record in the Supabase database with the images url and metadata.</p>
                </ol>

                <h2>Displaying the Gallery</h2>
                <p>Once the images are in the database, displaying them is straightforward. I query the database for all images and
                    map them to my gallery layout, then I render them with a simple grid in my frontend.
                </p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Integrating Supabase has simplified my workflow. Now, instead of having to modify my static html source code -
                    I can now simply add new portraits to my gallery just by logging in, uploading an image, and submitting the form.
                    The combination of secure authentincation, structured database storage, and hosted images makes Supabase a
                    perfect fit for my portraiture gallery.
                    <br><br>
                    If you are looking to manage a visual project without setting up an entire backend from scratch, I would recommmend
                    exploring Supabase. It's fast, reliable, and keeps all your data organized.
